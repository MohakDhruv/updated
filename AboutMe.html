    <p> Hello! My name is Mohak Dhruv. I have many passions and hobbies. 
        One thing is I <bold>love</bold> art! I also really enjoy reading. I am a black belt in martial arts, 
        I am good at archery, swordfighting and using the boStaff. However, one
        of my favorite hobbies are coding. If I could I would be coding almost all the time. I 
        take a coding class called WhiteHat Jr. and its amazing, 
        I have learned and almost mastered game-designing in Javascript and now I am doing html 
        website development. If any other kids enjoy coding or would like to learn coding I highly reccomend WhiteHat Jr.
        From these classes I have created multiple game and remade some too! Some of these are:
        online dino, monkey go happy, angry birds, and fruit ninja. To check these projects out go to the, "My projects" page.
